# Introduction
This is the repository for the core Morpher smart contract components of https://morpher.com

Morpher Smart Contracts are a collection of solidity files for on chain transactions and trustless state recovery from sidechain. ðŸ˜³

# Audit

The Non-Proxy versions of Morpher Smart Contracts are fully and regularly audited. ðŸ™Œ

 # Proxied vs Non-Proxied versions

There are two versions of the smart contracts:

## Non Proxied Contracts

Initially MorpherProtocol was written in a non-proxy way using Solidity 0.5 and the Eternal Storage Pattern.

Contracts are residing on [the nonproxy-master Branch](https://github.com/Morpher-io/MorpherProtocol/tree/unproxied-contracts).

### Addresses for Non Proxied Contracts

Updates are barely possible, that's also why the deployments are not managed through truffle artifacts. Addresses are stored in [addressesAndRoles.json](./docs/addressesAndRoles.json).

## Proxied Contracts

Q1/2022 the Contracts were updated to support the following things:

1. Proxied through transparent proxies for updating the contract logic
    
    * No more Eternal Storage Pattern. 
    * Contract storage is now used directly. 
    * Lowered Gas costs and made maintenance easier
    * MorpherState now holds only a Pointer to the Contracts in the Ecosystem, instead of the Storage.

2. Advanced Roles and Access Lists instead of a simple Ownable

    * Allows for more fine-grained access control
    * State having Administrators and Owner roles are not managed through [OpenZeppelin Access Control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control)

3. Usage of Foundry over Truffle for Unit-Testing

    * Usage for Foundry over Truffle for Tests
    * Still maintain the migration functionality from Truffle
    * Run Truffle and Foundry in Parallel

The Proxied Contracts can be found in [the proxy-master Branch](https://github.com/Morpher-io/MorpherProtocol/tree/proxied-contracts).

### Addresses for Proxied Contracts

For proxied contracts the build-artifacts are stored in the branch, they are not deleted. There is a helper function called printAddresses in the helpers directory. 

1. Switch over to the proxied-contracts branch
2. Connect Truffle to MetaMask: `truffle dashboard`
3. Select the right network from MetaMask (e.g. Polygon)
4. Run `truffle exec ./helpers/printAddresses.js --network dashboard`

At the time of writing, these are the addresses for Morpher Sidechain (Chain-ID 21), Mainnet (Chain-ID 1) and Polygon (Chain-ID 137):
