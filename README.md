# Introduction
This is the repository for the core Morpher smart contract components of https://morpher.com

Morpher Smart Contracts are a collection of solidity files for on-chain transactions to invest into different asset classes, such as Stocks, Commodities, Forex, but also into Unique Markets like Watches, Shoes and Football. ðŸ˜³

# Audit

Morpher Smart Contracts are fully and regularly audited. ðŸ™Œ

 * Audited by Solidified on April 12, 2021. [Full Report](./docs/solidified-audit-12.04.2021.pdf)
 * Audited by Capacity on April 20, 2020. [Full Report](./docs/Capacity-MorpherAudit2Result.pdf)


# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
* Git and Foundry

## Foundry and Truffle in the same projects

We migrated all the functionality from Truffle to Foundry. There is no Hardhat, Truffle or anything else necessary, just Foundry

## Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Morpher-io/MorpherProtocol.git
cd MorpherProtocol
git checkout account-abstraction
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## How to run the Tests
Tests are implemented using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh).

Run the following commands to start the test suite. ðŸ˜Ž
* Run `forge test` to run the tests

If you want to see exactly what assertions are being made, you can take a look at the `test_forge` folder.


# Smart Contract Components

There are several components playing together, these are here described in more detail in order of their importance.

Also, there are two versions of the Morpher Protocol. One with Proxies, and another, older one, without Proxies. On the Morpher Production Sidechain, as well as the Ethereum Mainchain, both versions are mixed, as the state was previously stored in MorpherState, but the Bridge was updated.

On Development networks, as well as Polygon Production networks, only the new, Proxied version is deployed.

## MorpherAccessControl.sol

This contract was introduced in the proxied contracts to manage access controls to the Morpher Contracts Ecosystem. The roles are defined in the respective Contracts, but can be summarized as follows:

* **MINTER_ROLE**: Is allowed to mint tokens, usually only given to other smart contracts. E.g. TradeEngine can mint, staking can mint, the faucet (on dev only) can mint
* **BURNER_ROLE**: Same as minterrole, just for burning
* **PAUSER_ROLE**: Can pause any mint/burn/transfer. Effectively pauses the whole protocol. Is assigned to the owner.
* **SIDECHAINOPERATOR_ROLE**: Is updating the Merkle Root, as well as triggers withdrawal functionality
* **ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE**: 
* ORACLEOPERATOR_ROLE
* STAKINGADMIN_ROLE
* GOVERNANCE_ROLE
* TRANSFER_ROLE
* ORACLE_ROLE
* POSITIONADMIN_ROLE
* USERBLOCKINGADMIN_ROLE
* POLYGONMINTER_ROLE

## MorpherState.sol

### Non-Proxy Version

This smart contract is _the brain_ of what happens with users, balances, trading and governance. It is the central point which stores balances for each user. It also stores the addresses of other smart contracts, such as the ERC20 token, the bridge or the governance functionality.

### Proxy Version

It holds a pointer to the other contracts. The State does nothing substantial anymore, all the actual information is stored on the proxied contracts themselves (Tokens in MorpherToken, Positions in TradeEngine, etc...)

## MorpherToken.sol

### Non-Proxy Version 

It is the ERC20 Compatible token for Morpher. All the balances are stored in MorpherState.sol, it's just the interface.

### Proxy Version

Its an ERC20 Token, that can be Minted

## MorpherTradeEngine.sol

This is the contract that processes and stores orders. The orders can only be given by the oracle smart contract. This smart contract is the trusted entity taking prices from outside into the sandboxed blockchain.


## MorpherBridge.sol

Morpher Bridge takes care of bridging functionality from Main-Chain to Side-Chain and vice versa. It contains functionality to burn tokens upon deposit on the main-chain and credit (or mint) tokens on the side-chain. It can also take the merkle-proofs from the side-chain and let you withdraw tokens on the main-chain. 

If side chain operator doesn't write a merkle root hash to main chain for more than 72 hours positions and balaces from side chain can be transferred to main chain.

## MorpherGovernance.sol

Every user able and willig to lock up sufficient token can become a validator of the Morpher protocol. Validators function similiar to a board of directors and vote on the protocol Administrator and the Oracle contract.

## MorpherAirdrop.sol

Holds the Airdrop Token balance on contract address. AirdropAdmin can authorize addresses to receive airdrop. Users have to claim their airdrop actively or Admin initiates transfer.

## MorpherEscrow.sol

Escrow contract to safely store and release the token allocated to Morpher at protocol inception.

## MorpherOracle.sol

The oracle initates a new trade by calling trade engine and requesting a new orderId. An event is fired by the contract notifying the oracle operator to query a price/liquidation unchecked for a market/user and return the information via the callback function. Since calling the callback function requires gas, the user must send a fixed amount of Ether when creating their order.

## Important Functionality

MorpherState, by default, doesn't let anyone transfer tokens. This has to be enabled, but is disabled by default. By calling the following functions the access to transfers, minting, burning and creating positions will be enabled:

```
grantAccess(morpherTokenAddress)
grantAccess(morpherTradeEngineAddress)
grantAccess(morpherBridgeAddress)
grantAccess(morpherGovernanceAddress)
```

To let a sidechain operator set the amount of tokens on a sidechain, it has to be set by the owner initially:
```
setSideChainOperator(sideChainOperatorAddress)
```

For sidechain operations (only relevant on sidechain) some transfers need to be enabled:
```
enableTransfers(addressOfDeployer)
enableTransfers(morpherAirdropAddress)
```

Initially the governance contract did not vote on an administrator or oracle yet. To have an Admin or Oracle until there is a vote in the governance contract two addresses need to be set:
```
setGovernanceContract(addressOfDeployer)
setAdministrator(addressOfDeployer)
```

To set the protocol contracts in state, the following functions need to be called:

```
setTokenContract(morpherTokenAddress)
setMorpherBridge(bridgeAddress)
setOracleContract(oracleAddress)
```

To enable "CRYPTO_BTC" and "CRYPTO_ETH" as markets for testing purposes;
```
activateMarket(0x0bc89e95f9fdaab7e8a11719155f2fd638cb0f665623f3d12aab71d1a125daf9)
activateMarket(0x5376ff169a3705b2003892fe730060ee74ec83e5701da29318221aa782271779)
```

To set the governance properly _on main chain only_:
```
setGovernanceContract(morpherGovernanceAddress)
```

And to transfer the ownership, potentially to a 0x0 address:

```
transferOwnership(ownerAddress)
```

# Deployed Contracts

The Smart Contracts are deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet and on the Morpher Sidechain, as well as Polygon.

Mainchain and Sidechain contains a mix of Proxied and non-proxied contracts. To understand which ones are which, please consult the [Master-Branch Readme](https://github.com/Morpher-io/MorpherProtocol) which gives an overview

Polygon and all Test-Networks contains exclusively the Proxied contracts. Run:

`truffle dashboard` to connect to MetaMask and select the right network. 
Then run `truffle exec ./helpers/printAddresses.js --network dashboard` to print the addresses.

At the time of writing, these are the addresses for Polygon:
