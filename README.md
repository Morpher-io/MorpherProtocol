# Introduction
This is the repository for the core Morpher smart contract components of https://morpher.com

Morpher Smart Contracts are a collection of solidity files for on chain transactions and trustless state recovery from sidechain. ðŸ˜³

 # Proxied vs Non-Proxied versions

There are two versions of the smart contracts:

## Non Proxied Contracts

Initially MorpherProtocol was written in a non-proxy way using Solidity 0.5 and the Eternal Storage Pattern.

Contracts are residing on [the nonproxy-master Branch](/Morpher-io/MorpherProtocol/tree/dev)

## Proxied Contracts

# Contracts

## Interfaces
IERC20.sol: Interface for the ERC20 Token

IMorpherStaking.sol: Interface for the Staking functionality

IMorpherState.sol: Interface for the State functions

IMorpherToken.sol: Interface for the Morpher Token

## Auxiliary Contracts
MerkleProof.sol: Calculate the Merkle Proof

Migrations.sol: Used by Truffle to store migrations on chain

Ownable.sol: Ownable functionality

SafeMath.sol: Prevent Integer Overflows/Underflows in Solidity < 0.8

## Morpher Core Contracts

MorpherBridge.sol: Functionality to bridge tokens between chains in a trustless way

MorpherOracle.sol: Pricing Oracle Functionality that accepts high frequency price ticks from external trusted data sources

MorpherStaking.sol: Staking functionality for MPH

MorpherState.sol: Storing Data On Chain using the Eternal Storage Pattern (only non-proxied)

MorpherToken.sol: ERC20 Interface for the Morpher Token

MorpherTradeEngine.sol: Processing Trades, calculating the position value
